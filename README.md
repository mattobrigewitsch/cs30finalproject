# cs30finalproject

# the goal of the project was to recreate pokemon with ambigous scripts allowing for easy change
# this goal was largely met, with no code being "railroaded"

# the files uploaded are all the scripts used, but many are reuploads that are unchanged from previous projects
# this is mostly my project from last year.
# the three codes that I mostly used were BasePokemon, BattleManager, and GameManager. 
# these codes have comments, the rest are only for reference. I didn't comment them as they were not part of the project this year.

# the code is not runnable from GitHub, I have and executable im sharing on Drive. 
# make sure the executable is named the same as the files or it will throw an error, and Drive likes renaming it for some reason,
# something to do with have 2 equally named files.

# I ended up continuing the project, and completed the battle system 100%. If you'd like the code for that, you can contact me.
# It is very easy to input in other values, and would only take ~15 hours to make a game out of.
