# cs30finalproject

the goal of the project was to recreate pokemon with ambigous scripts allowing for easy change
this goal was largely met, with no code being "railroaded"

the files uploaded are all the scripts used, but many are reuploads that are unchanged from previous projects
this is mostly my project from last year.
the three codes that I mostly used were BasePokemon, BattleManager, and GameManager. 
these codes have comments, the rest are only for reference. I didn't comment them as they were not part of the project this year.

the code is not runnable from GitHub, I have and executable im sharing on Drive. 
make sure the executable is named the same as the files or it will throw an error, and Drive likes renaming it for some reason,
something to do with have 2 equally named files. The game can be quit by clicking escape on the overworld
(I believe I removed this in the test verion I uploaded due to conflictions with the BattleManager KeyCode(Escape), and I was testing it,
if it isn't work just alt-tab out, sorry about that)

The files follow a naming convention where the capitalization changes based on how the value is used. An example is that all classes are
named in a them of ExampleClass, where the first letter of every word is capitilized. Additionally, a list of ExampleClass would be named
exampleList. I will not label every example of this, but I realise this isn't standard, but it helped me keep track of my values, 
especially when there was likely over 100 values towards the end of the project.

I ended up continuing the project, and completed the battle system 100%. If you'd like the code for that, you can contact me.
It is very easy to input in other values, and would only take ~15 hours to make a game out of.
