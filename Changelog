December 29 - Finished recreating the project from last year in a new test environment
January 2 - Realised a problem with nested classes
January 3 - Got rid of all nested classes in BasePokemon, replaced it all with intergers in BasePokemon
January 4 - Big day. Introduced a new stat gain function into BasePokemon, removed ID system, and began changing GameManager
January 7 - Finished up some tweaks to GameManager where Stat Gains would effect Base Stats, irreperably changing the prefab pokemon. 
this resulted in exponentially stronger pokemon, and your own pokemon being effected by the stat gains of the oppenents. This was done
by creating a momentary clone class of the prefab, changing it, and appending it to a list if it was one of the players, deleting the old
instance from the same list.
January 9 - Began changing enemys to be affected by stat gain
January 10 - Continue work from 9, finishing it. This can be seen as the chunks of code in GameManager's EnterBattle function
January 11 - Worked on moves in fighting, big day. Created a new way of indexing moves based on a move code, and storing moves as
learnedMoves solely as ints. This was done because the same error was thrown as before with the nested classes not being properly cloned.
I also began appending battle manager to create a test fight system update, with damage. Created damage formula, derived from
https://www.serebii.net/games/damage.shtml. 
January 12 - Finished the new fighting system to properly calulate damage, aswell as index moves for both player and enemy. Removed enemy
moves from test copy as they haven't been properly tested, and I don't want to be embarrassed by an error in presentation.
